    // but a closure that moves a captured value out of the body
    // only implements `FnOnce` but not another traits
    // and can only be called once

    // 2. `FnMut`: closures that don't move captured values out of the body
    // but might mutate the captured values
    // these closures can be called more than once

    // 3. `Fn`: closures that don't move captured values out of the body,
    // and don't mutate captured values
    // can be called more than once without mutating the environment
    // important for situations where a closure is called multiple times concurrently
