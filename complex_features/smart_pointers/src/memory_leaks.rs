// weak references don't express ownership relationship
// weak count doesn't affect when a value is cleaned up
// any cycle with weak references get broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0

// because the value that Weak<T> references might be dropped
// to do anything with that value requires calling `upgrade` method on the Weak<T> instance
// to return an `Option<Rc<T>>`
// gets `Some<Rc<T>>` if the value has not dropped yet; and `None` if the value has been dropped
// therefore, there wont' be an invalid pointer
