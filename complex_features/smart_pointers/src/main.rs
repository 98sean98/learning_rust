// smart pointers are structs that implement `Deref` and `Drop` traits

// `Deref` allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference
// so that code can work with either references or smart pointers

// `Drop` allows you to customize the code that's run when an instance of the smart
// pointer goes out of scope
